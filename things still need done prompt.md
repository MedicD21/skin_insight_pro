Things Still Need Done Prompt

Copy/paste prompt:

You are working in the repo /Users/dustinschaaf/Desktop/skin_insight_pro. Review the file `things still need done.md` and execute all items in order. Keep changes minimal, explain each change, and do not remove unrelated work. Prefer `rg` for search and `apply_patch` for small edits. Add any SQL or Supabase steps as runnable snippets. For each item:

- Identify current state and relevant files or tables.
- Implement the fix or add missing capability.
- Validate with a quick smoke test or describe how I can test.
- Call out any Supabase dashboard steps required.

Keep a running checklist in your response. If you need clarification, ask only after attempting to infer context from the repo.
